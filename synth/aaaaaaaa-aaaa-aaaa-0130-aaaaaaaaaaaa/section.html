<h2>A minimal yet proper entry section page</h2>
<p>
This is the entry point of a minimal page that should be serious enough to be
classified as a proper section by our section identifier. This is text is here only
to make it looks like a real section.
</p>

<p>
Therefore the induction should start properly and reach the articles whose links can be found here:
</p>

	 <div class="articles">
	    <B>Highlights</B>:
		<ul>
		  <li><a href="articles/article1.html">First leading to article 1.</a> </li>
		  <li><a href="articles/article2.html">Second leading to article 2.</a></li>
		  <li><a href="articles/article3.html">Third leading to article 3.</a></li>
		</ul>
	 </div>  

</body>
</html>
